        reading is my favorite hobby, it is fun and entertaining (and some times educational. I really like funny books because I like laughing. Books are also very common in great quantities and in all sorts of styles. But i usually run out of good books (they are kinda expensive). Running is also fun, but tiring. It's also good exersize. It also makes your legs strong. In conclusion,I like laughing, running, and good exercise.

          book: Holes
          <br>
          review: an edgy exciting story about an unlucky boy who is falsly accused for stealing a celebrity's sneakers and is sent to camp greenlake (there is no green lake. just brown hard dry ground) and starts digging holes. a good book.
